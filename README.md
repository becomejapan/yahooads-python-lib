# yahooads-python-lib
Client library for Yahoo Promotional Ads SOAP API. Implementation took inspiration from google's client library
counterpart [googleads-python-lib](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-lib). It is based on suds SOAP library
and provide access to Promotional Ads API using python.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this library

2. Install with [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

   `$ python setup.py build install`

3. Copy the [yahooads.yaml](https://github.com/becomejapan/promotionalads-python-lib/blob/master/yahooads.yaml)
   file to your home directory and fill in the account access credentials.

## Examples

The examples found in [examples](https://github.com/becomejapan/promotionalads-python-lib/tree/master/examples) folder
are auto generated by `api_reference_example_generator.py` using sample SOAP messages in the official
[Promotional Ads Reference](https://github.com/yahoojp-marketing/sponsored-search-api-documents).
Example generator uses `sample_context.yaml` file to replace the representative Ids in API Reference examples
(like `accountId`, `campaignId` `adgroupId` etc.), hence to generate runnable example code
the context file can be updated with account context (preferably of a test account).

## Logging SOAP messages

The library uses `suds` SOAP library which uses Python logging framework. The SOAP messages can be logged at client
and transport levels adding following code.
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger('suds.client').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('suds.transport').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```


## Future Work

1. Add testing
2. Sanitize example code (some examples contains unsupported fields due to out-dated reference SOAP messages)
3. Support for YDN
